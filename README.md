outside the window. It can be trivially rejected.
3. If a line cannot be trivially accepted or rejected, at least one of the two endpoints must lie outside the window and the line segment crosses a window edge. This line must be clipped at the window edge before being passed to the drawing routine.
4. Examine one of the endpoints, say p1=(x1,y1), read p1's
4-bit code in order: Left-to-Right, Bottom-to-Top.

## What Is OpenGL?
OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists of about 150
distinct commands that you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce
interactive three-dimensional applications.
OpenGL is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be implemented
on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these qualities, no commands for
performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL; instead, you
must work through whatever windowing system controls the particular hardware you're
using. Similarly, OpenGL doesn't provide high-level commands for describing models of
three-dimensional objects. Such commands might allow you to specify relatively.
complicated shapes such as automobiles, parts of the body, airplanes, or molecules. With
OpenGL, you must build up your desired model from a small set of geometric primitives -
points, lines, and polygons.
A sophisticated library that provides these features could certainly be built on top of
OpenGL. The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) provides many of the modeling features,
such as quadric surfaces and NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) curves and
surfaces. GLU is a standard part of every OpenGL implementation. Also, there is a higher-
level, object-oriented toolkit, Open Inventor, which is built atop OpenGL, and is available
separately for many implementations of OpenGL.

## OpenGL-Related Libraries
OpenGL provides a powerful but primitive set of rendering commands, and all higher-
level drawing must be done in terms of these commands. Also, OpenGL programs have to
use the underlying mechanisms of the windowing system. A number of libraries exist to
allow you to simplify your programming tasks, including the following:

* The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) contains several routines that use lower-level
OpenGL commands to perform such tasks as setting up matrices for specific
viewing orientations and projections, performing polygon tessellation, and
rendering surfaces. This library is provided as part of every OpenGL
implementation. GLU routines use the prefix glu.

* For every window system, there is a library that extends the functionality of that
window system to support OpenGL rendering. For machines that use the X
Window System, the OpenGL Extension to the X Window System (GLX) is
provided as an adjunct to OpenGL. GLX routines use the prefix glX. For Microsoft
Windows, the WGL routines provide the Windows to OpenGL interface. All WGL
routines use the prefix wgl. For IBM OS/2, the PGL is the Presentation Manager to
OpenGL interface, and its routines use the prefix pgl.

* The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a window system-independent toolkit,
written by Mark Kilgard, to hide the complexities of differing window system
APIs. GLUT routines use the prefix glut.

* Open Inventor is an object-oriented toolkit based on OpenGL which provides
objects and methods for creating interactive three-dimensional graphics
applications. Open Inventor, which is written in C++, provides prebuilt objects and
a built-in event model for user interaction, high-level application components for
creating and editing three-dimensional scenes, and the ability to print objects and
exchange data in other graphics formats. Open Inventor is separate from OpenGL.
## Include Files
For all OpenGL applications, you want to include the gl.h header file in every file. Almost
all OpenGL applications use GLU, the aforementioned OpenGL Utility Library, which
requires inclusion of the glu.h header file. So almost every OpenGL source file begins
with
#include <GL/gl.h>
#include <GL/glu.h>

* If you are directly accessing a window interface library to support OpenGL, such as GLX,
AGL, PGL, or WGL, you must include additional header files. For example, if you are
calling GLX, you may need to add these lines to your code
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <GL/glx.h>

* If you are using GLUT for managing your window manager tasks, you should include
#include <GL/glut.h>

* Note that glut.h includes gl.h, glu.h, and glx.h automatically, so including all three files is
redundant. GLUT for Microsoft Windows includes the appropriate header file to access
WGL.
## GLUT, the OpenGL Utility Toolkit
As you know, OpenGL contains rendering commands but is designed to be independent of
any window system or operating system. Consequently, it contains no commands for
opening windows or reading events from the keyboard or mouse. Unfortunately, it's
impossible to write a complete graphics program without at least opening a window, and
most interesting programs require a bit of user input or other services from the operating
system or window system.

* In addition, since OpenGL drawing commands are limited to those that generate simple
geometric primitives (points, lines, and polygons), GLUT includes several routines that
create more complicated three-dimensional objects such as a sphere, a torus, and a teapot

This way, snapshots of program output can be interesting to look at. (Note that the
OpenGL Utility Library, GLU, also has quadrics routines that create some of the same
three-dimensional objects as GLUT, such as a sphere, cylinder, or cone.)

## Important features of OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)
* Provides functionality common to all window systems.
* Open a window.
* Get input from mouse and keyboard.
* Menus.
* Event-driven.
* Code is portable but GLUT lacks the functionality of a good toolkit for a specific
platform.
* No slide bars.
* OpenGL is not object oriented so that there are multiple functions for a given
logical function :
glVertex3f
o glVertex2i
o glVertex3dv

* Underlying storage mode is the same easy to create overloaded functions in C++
but issue is efficiency.

## OpenGL Interface
o GL (OpenGL in Windows)
o GLU (graphics utility library)
uses only GL functions, creates common objects (such as spheres)
o GLUT (GL Utility Toolkit)
interfaces with the window system
o GLX: glue between OpenGL and Xwindow, used by GLUT

* Window Management
Five routines perform tasks necessary to initialize a window.

glutInit(int *argc, char ** argv) initializes GLUT and processes any command line
arguments (for X, this would be options like -display and -geometry). glutInit()
should be called before any other GLUT routine.

## glutInitDisplayMode(unsigned int mode) specifies whether to use an RGBA or
color-index color model. You can also specify whether you want a single- or
double-buffered window. (If you're working in color-index mode, you'll want to
load certain colors into the color map; use glutSetColor() to do this.) Finally, you
can use this routine to indicate that you want the window to have an associated
depth, stencil, and/or accumulation buffer. For example, if you want a window
with double buffering, the RGBA color model, and a depth buffer, you might call
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH).

* glutInitWindowPosition(int x, int y) specifies the screen location for the upper-
left corner of your window.

* glutInitWindowSize(int width, int size) specifies the size, in pixels, of your
window.

* int glutCreateWindow(char *string) creates a window with an OpenGL context. It
returns a unique identifier for the new window. Be warned: Until glutMainLoop()
is called (see next section), the window is not yet displayed.
The Display Callback
glutDisplayFunc(void (*func)(void)) is the first and most important event callback
function you will see. Whenever GLUT determines the contents of the window need to be
redisplayed, the callback function registered by glutDisplayFunc() is executed. Therefore,
you should put all the routines you need to redraw the scene in the display callback
function.
If your program changes the contents of the window, sometimes you will have to call
glutPostRedisplay(void), which gives glutMainLoop() a nudge to call the registered
display callback at its next opportunity.
Running the Program
The very last thing you must do is call glutMainLoop(void). All windows that have been
created are now shown, and rendering to those windows is now effective. Event
processing begins, and the registered display callback is triggered. Once this loop is
entered, it is never exited!.
